- final Keyword: The final keyword prevents a class, method, or property from being overridden or subclassed.

- AnyObject: 
	- AnyObject is a protocol that represents any class type (not struct or enum). 
	- It's often used in: Protocol constraints, Collections of heterogeneous objects.
//code example
class Dog {}
class Cat {}

let animals: [AnyObject] = [Dog(), Cat()]  // Only class instances allowed

//code example 2
protocol Named: AnyObject {
    var name: String { get }
}

This says: Only class types can conform to Named, not struct or enum.


- @viewBuilder modifier in swiftui: It flattens block of views into a single view using Group wrapper internaly.

//exmaple
func myView() -> some View {
    Text("Hello")
    Text("World") // ❌ Error: function must return a single View
}

//if we use @viewBuilder, error will be gone.
@viewBuilder
func myView() -> some View {
	Text("Hello")
    Text("World") 
}
